You can find the files in the repositories or have a live view in this link:

## Purpose of the dashboard
Apart from the daily income for each city, We want to understand the purchasing group by weekday and also the spending categories for different factors we currently recorded. 

## Demographics
You can see the four pie charts at the left hand side of the dashboard. By clicking one of the elements you interested, you can see the spending and revenue will change for what you choose.

By choosing the city of Yangon, the income and spending will only designated to the specific city of supermarket located. From the tree diagram, we can see customer in Yangon have the highest avengae spending in Home and lifestyle.You can also point to the categories in purchasing graph for having a look in each weekday. 

It turns out customer love to decorate their house in Yangon city especially in Sunday.

### Date and categories
What if I only want to look at January to February's electronic accessories situation? You can first specify the date at the top right corner and then selecting the electronic accessories in tree diagram. The graphs and index will automatically shown to you. 

We can see Yangon usually have a pretty good record compare to the other 2 city's supermarket.
